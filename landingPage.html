                Itâ€™s year 2020. A mysterious virus starts to rapidly spread causing panic all around the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                The government has made a decision to put the nation in a lockdown state to slow down the spread of the virus while a vaccine is being developed. Offices and schools close down. Parents struggle to work from home while home-schooling their children.
                <br>
                <br>
                The lockdown creates a sense of isolation as many struggle to maintain mental health.
