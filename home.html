                Youâ€™re a working parent of two kids also studying at university. With lockdown in place you are faced with home-schooling and working/studying from home.
                <br>
                <br>
                Choose between available scenarios. Each scenario will increase one of your stats, but at the same reduce another one. Your stats can be rated as Excellent, Good, Bad and Terrible, where Excellent is the best and Terrible is the worst.
                <br>
                <br>
                The game will end if any of your stats reach Terrible level.
